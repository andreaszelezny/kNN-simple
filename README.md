# kNN-simple
Very simple k-Nearest-Neighbor (i.e., 1NN) for digit recognition. Created in an F# dojo.

This F# dojo is directly inspired by the 
Digit Recognizer competition from Kaggle.com:
http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
 
The goal of the dojo will be to
create a classifier that uses training data
to recognize hand-written digits, and
evaluate the quality of our classifier
by looking at predictions on the validation data.
